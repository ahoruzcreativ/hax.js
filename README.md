HaxBall is a great multiplayer air hockey / soccer game that resides at http://haxball.com/

hax.js is a purely JavaScript port of it where the backend is written in Node.js using socket.io and the front-end uses canvas and any transport technology available to the browser. That way, the game is playable on iOS devices.
